# Vert.x WebAuthN Auth

This module contains contains an experimental Vert.x auth implementation which uses WebAuthN.

FIDO2 is a "passwordless" authentication mechanism and the JavaScript API is more known as WebAuthN.

WebAuthN allows users to authenticate using a secure device or token and no passwords are exchange between the browser
and the server (also known as Relay Party).

The current implementation supports both authentication and device attestation.

Device attestation is a verification of the device itself. Currently the following attestations are implemented:

* U2F (FIDO-U2F tokens, e.g.: Yubikey's)
* Packed
* Android Key

Still not implemented are:

* Android Safetynet
* TPM
