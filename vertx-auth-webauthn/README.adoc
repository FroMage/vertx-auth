= Vert.x WebAuthN Auth

This module contains contains a https://github.com/herrjemand/awesome-webauthn#server-libs[FIDO CONFORMANT] Vert.x auth implementation for FIDO2 WebAuthn.

FIDO2 is a "passwordless" authentication mechanism and the JavaScript API is more known as WebAuthN.

WebAuthN allows users to authenticate using a secure device or token and no passwords are exchange between the browser and the server (also known as Relay Party).

Device attestation is a verification of the device itself.
Currently the following attestations are implemented:

* none
* U2F (FIDO-U2F tokens, e.g.: Yubikey's)
* Packed
* Android Key
* Android Safetynet
* TPM
* Apple
