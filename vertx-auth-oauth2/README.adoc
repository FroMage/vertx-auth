== Running test

Standard unit tests are run against a mock of some providers, `Google`, `Keycloak` to run
against a real provider (`Keycloak`) the `IT` profile must be enabled, which you can do by:

[source]
----
mvn -PIT ...
----

Or by having the environment variable `TRAVIS` set to `true`. When running the integration
tests you must have a local keycloak installed with the configuration file `src/test/fixtures/vertx-test-realm.json`.

And the container can be run locally as:

[source]
----
# build the image if not present
docker build -t vertx-test-keycloak src/test/fixtures
# run once there is a image
docker run -d -p 8888:8080 vertx-test-keycloak
----

=== IntelliJ IDE

In IntelliJ IDE, you have to uncheck `argLine` in Preferences -> Build,Execution,Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven -> Running Tests ...

to avoid `IntelliJ Error when running unit test: Could not find or load main class ${surefireArgLine}`
